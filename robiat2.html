<p><h3> I am MUHAMMED BISOLA ROBIAT. I am simple, sweet, confident fellow. My father is a renowned doctor who knows how to love his profession with passion and dedication. While my mother is a hardworking teacher at city public school whose only passion is to transform the lives of her students with knowledge and a good vision.
That’s I have learned, from the very start, the importance of passion, dedication, confidence and time management. We are four brothers and sisters among our parents and my grandmother. My family is what my parents had worked for, ie completely happy and satisfied one.
I am the youngest of my only brother and two sisters. My elder brother is just six years elder in age than me. My other two elder sisters are younger than my brother. Being the eldest one, sometimes, gives you the favors. Luckily, I am loved, cared and most favored upon in my all family.
I am a student of kwara state university. One elder sister of mine is the college student whereas the the youngest sister of mine is studying in the secondary school. That’s, I go to school with my younger sister.
I wake up early in the morning and finish up all of my doings on exact time. We all pack up for our respective works. My siblings prepare for school, and university. My father, for hospital and my mother for nearby school. Hard work, time management, sincerity with work and dedication to purpose have been ingrained in our nature.
